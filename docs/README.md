# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Protocol.Land

Protocol.Land is a platform designed to support the needs of developers. It ensures uninterrupted access to codebases while safeguarding the longevity of the code.

It is built on top of the Arweave network making each hosted repository permanent and immutable. With at least 200 years of preservation with 20 backups available at any time, this robust structure eliminates downtime issues.

Moreover, each update to the repositories is verifiably recorded on Arweave providing transparency and maintaining the integrity of codebases.

## Enhancing Code Collaboration with Protocol.Land

Protocol.Land combines the familiarity of Git with the benefits of decentralization. Your usual process â€” creating repositories, forking, cloning, committing, and pushing changes â€” remains unchanged, but with the added security and benefits of Arweave.

Weâ€™ve integrated some unique features to enhance the developer experience. Letâ€™s explore them:

- **Add Bounties for Contributions:** With Protocol.Land, you can assign bounties to issues, offering the ability to reward contributors for their efforts.
- **Private Repositories:** While Arweave typically stores data publicly, Protocol.Land allows for the creation of private repositories through encryption. This feature offers enhanced security and privacy for your sensitive projects.
- **Deploy Static Pages on Arweave:** Just like deploying web apps from tools like Vercel, Protocol.Land provides a built-in solution powered by Dragon Deploy to deploy static pages on Arweave.
- **Assign User-Friendly Names to Static Pages:** Pages deployed on Arweave are represented by a unique transaction id. Protocol.Land offers a streamlined solution to assign user-friendly names to these deployments using the Arweave Name System (ArNS) making the pages easier to search.
