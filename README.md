# Protocol Land

Where decentralized protocols roam

## Motivation

## Structure

-

## Core Features

- Immutable Source Control: code is stored within the Arweave, so incentives exist to ensure the code is always available and never changable post-commit
- Democratic Pull Requests: ensure codebase management occurs via correctly incentivized parties

## Tools to be used

- Arweave: decentralized & immutable storage
- AFTR: codebase governance
- ArConnect: user accounts
- Othent: user accounts
- PermawebJS: decentralized framework stack
