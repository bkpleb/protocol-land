## Dragon Deploy: Redefining Static Page Deployment with Protocol.Land
Protocol.Land’s [Dragon Deploy](https://dragondeploy.xyz) integration —an innovative feature to reshape the landscape of deploying static pages on Arweave. This enhancement streamlines the deployment process, creating a smooth flow for developers writing code on the permaweb.

Protocol.Land's web UI simplifies static page deployment on Arweave, offering a user-friendly experience with just a few clicks. The intuitive interface ensures a trouble-free experience for developers.

### Blend of the Old and New
Deploying a static page on Arweave means entering Permaweb, a decentralized and permanent hosting solution that breaks free from traditional hosting constraints. With Git integration, Protocol.Land allows developers to navigate their projects seamlessly, blending a typical workflow with innovative features.

Prior to Dragon Deploy, users could host a static website on Arweave using ArDrive. If you were hosting your site on a CMS, like WordPress, you needed to use a WordPress static site generator and upload the files (assets) onto ArDrive, and create a manifest. Now, similar to how you can host a static site on GitHub with [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages), Protocol.Land offers the option to do so with [Dragon Deploy](https://docs.protocol.land/working-with-deployments/deploy-a-static-page).

- **Streamlined Deployment Process:** Dragon Deploy simplifies the deployment of static pages on Arweave through an intuitive web UI. With a few clicks, developers can seamlessly enter the Permaweb, Arweave’s decentralized hosting solution. This streamlined process eliminates the complexities associated with traditional hosting platforms, enabling developers to focus more on coding and less on deployment logistics.
- **Eternal Preservation and Accessibility:** Deployed code on Arweave via Dragon Deploy benefits from eternal preservation on the Arweave network. On-chain snapshots, facilitated by Warp contracts, transform each commit into a permanent record, providing a verifiable history crucial for tracking progress and validating the integrity of the work. The Arweave Name System (ArNS) enhances accessibility by providing user-friendly aliases for deployments, making it easier for developers and end-users to access and interact with deployed content.

### Get Started
