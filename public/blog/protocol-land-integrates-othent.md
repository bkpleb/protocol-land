## Discover a seamless and secure way to access Protocol Land with social logins
We're thrilled to announce the launch of Othent integration with Protocol Land! This collaboration removes the barrier of complex wallet creation, allowing users to sign up and log in seamlessly with their existing social media accounts.

### Why Opt for Social Login in Protocol.Land?
In the fast-paced world of Web3, user onboarding and authentication play a crucial role in driving adoption and engagement. Traditional methods of creating and accessing web3 wallets, such as seed phrases, can be complex and intimidating for both crypto-natives and mainstream users. However, there is a game-changing solution: social sign-ins. These familiar login methods, powered by cutting-edge technologies like Othent, offer a bridge between Web2 and Web3, providing a user-friendly experience to access Protocol Land.

### How does Othent work?
Othent pairs the convenience of Web2 login services like Google, Twitter, GitHub, and Microsoft with the power and security of dApps. To learn more about how Othent works, check out the Othent documentation [here](https://docs.othent.io/developers/sdk).
